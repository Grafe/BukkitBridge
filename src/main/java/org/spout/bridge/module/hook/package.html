<p>The hook package is used for the creation and processing of hooks. {@link org.spout.bridge.module.hook.Hook Hooks} are used
to communicate between modules. The {@link org.spout.bridge.module.hook.Query Query} subclass of Hook can be used to retrieve
information from a module, whereas the normal Hook class can only send it. Because of this, Hooks are used by modules to change
data (set methods) and Queries are used to retrieve data (get methods). The {@link org.spout.bridge.module.hook.NodeQuery NodeQuery}
class is used to deal with Queries based off of {@link org.spout.bridge.module.NodeHandler nodes} and is used by most of Bridge
due to the organization provided by nodes. The {@link org.spout.bridge.module.hook.NodeQueryHandler NodeQueryHandler} class is
a subclass provided to make parsing NodeQueries easier.
